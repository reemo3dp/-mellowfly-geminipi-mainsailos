# MainsailOS for Gemini v3

A MainsailOS image built from the latest [armbian image I maintain](https://github.com/reemo3dp/mellowfly-geminipi-armbian).

Setup like armbian, use UART shell to run `sudo nmtui` to connect to a Wifi network. Or follow the instructions found in `/boot/network_config.txt.template`
